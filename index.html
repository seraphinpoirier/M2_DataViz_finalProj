    <h1>Do you speak american ?</h1>
    <p>The United States of America are often considered to be a country
        where everyone speaks English.
        However, the reality is way more surprising ! 
        Let's bring out some visualisations that will help us better understand the reality of "speaking american".
    </p>
    
    <h2>Languages by State</h2>
    <p> Let's start with an overview of all languages spoken in all of the states. You can click on any state to see exactly what <b>languages are spoken there</b>, and by <b>how many people</b>.
        Obviously, keep in mind that the most populated states will have more speakers of all languages, so the numbers are not directly comparable across states.
    </p>
    
    <div class="map-and-list">
        <div id="map-container"></div>

        <div id="selected-state-info">
            <h3>Languages spoken in <span id="selected-state">Select a state</span></h3>
            <div id="languages-container"></div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>State-by-state breakdown</h2>
    <p>
        On this visualisation, you can observe how the <b>share of speakers of each language by state</b>. For most of them, it is very clear that
        English is the most spoken ! So the second graph shows the proportion without it. 
        <br>
        All languages spoken by less than 1% of the population are grouped together, for readability purposes.
    </p>
    <div id="pie-section">
        <div class="pie-controls">
            <label for="pie-state-select">Select state:</label>
            <select id="pie-state-select">
                <option value="">Nationwide</option>
            </select>
        </div>

        <div id="pie-container">
            <div class="pie-box" id="pie-with-eng">
                <!-- caption and svg inserted by JS -->
            </div>
            <div class="pie-box" id="pie-no-eng">
                <!-- caption and svg inserted by JS -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Language dispersion vs. speakers</h2>
    <p>
        All languages are not created equal: some are <b>widely spoken accross all states</b>, while others are <b>way more localised</b>.
        On this graph, you can see the relation between the <b>amount of speakers (Y axis)</b> and the <b>amount of states in which a language is spoken (X axis)</b>.
        You can highlight a specific language by typing its name in the search bar, and see its position on the graph.
        <br>
        <br> Because English and Spanish are so much ahead in term of total speakers, we took the decision to exclude them from this graph.
        <br> According to our data, English was spoken by 231 122 908 people in the US in 2013, and Spanish by 37 458 491 people. Both were spoken accross all states.
        <br>
        <br> Try to identify the <b>outliers</b>: languages widely spoken but restricted to some states, or on the contrary languages spoken in many states but by few people in each of them.
    </p>
    <div id="dot-section">
        <div class="dot-controls">
            <label for="language-search">Search language:</label>
            <input type="text" id="language-search" list="language-list" placeholder="Type language name...">
            <datalist id="language-list"></datalist>

        <div id="dot-container"></div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Top 15 languages</h2>
    <p>This bar chart is showing the <b>15 most-spoken languages nationwide (total speakers)</b>. Because English and Spanish are so far
        ahead in the results, you can <b>hide them to change the scale</b> and have a better idea of the distribution.<br><br>
    </p>
    <div class="bar-controls">
        <label><input type="checkbox" id="bar-english-check" checked /> Include English</label>
        <label><input type="checkbox" id="bar-spanish-check" checked /> Include Spanish</label>
    </div>
    <div id="bar-section">
        <div id="bar-container"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Distribution of English Proficiency by State</h2>
    <p>
        People talking a lot of languages in the country also means that <b>some of them do not speak English very well</b>.
        Of course, this can prove to be a <b>problem</b> when dealing with the administration, looking for a job, or even just trying to get by in daily life.
        <br><br>This box plot shows the <b>distribution of the proportion of people who don't speak English "very well"</b> across all states.
        We can see that the situation varies a lot by state, with a minimum of less than 1% and a high above 15% !

    <h2>English Proficiency by State Map</h2>
    <p>This map shows the <b>proportion of people who speak English less than "Very Well"</b> compared to the total state population.
        <br> It is interesting to note that the states with the highest proportion are usually the ones where the most languages are spoken.
        <br>
        <br>

    </p>
    <div id="english-proficiency-map-container"></div>

    <h2>Speakers of English less than "Very Well"</h2>
    <p>Here is a bar chart showing the number of people who speak English less than "Very Well" by state, ordered by number. Includes margin of error.
        <b>We only show the 15 states with the highest number of speakers</b>, for readability purposes. This means that some states might have a higher proportion than ones here, but a lower number in total.
    </p>
    <div class="english-histogram-controls">
        <label><input type="checkbox" id="histogram-nationwide-check" checked /> Include Nationwide Total</label>
    </div>
    <div id="english-histogram-container"></div>

    <h2>Search a language</h2>
    <p>It's almost the end ! Here, you can just <b>type a language name</b> and select it to view its distribution across states.
        Start with the ones you speak, then try to find some rare ones and see where they are spoken ! 
        <br>Be careful, however, this map <b>only shows proportions and not absolute numbers</b>. Some languages can have strong communities in a state and yet appear with a low proportion.<br><br>
