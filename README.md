# M2_DataViz_finalProj
Data Visualisation final project

## Website building
To build this webiste locally, you do not need any other files than the ones provided here. However, due to D3.js specifications, you might need to run it on a localhost to see the visualisations. It is advised to visit this website directly on the git page in order to see it fully functioning.

## Data Hosting
All of the data used is stored within the "data" folder of this project. It comes from the following Kaggle datasets:
