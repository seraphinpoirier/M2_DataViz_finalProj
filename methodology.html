    <h1>Methodology</h1>
    <p>This project explores language use and English proficiency across US states using publicly available census-based datasets.</p>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
        The data used by this website has been sources from the following Kaggle datasets:
        <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amartinson193/us-languages-census-data-20092013" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Languages Census Data (2009-2013)</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quarkspark/us-statewise-population-2010-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Statewise Population (2010-2019)</a></li>
        </ul>    
    </p>

    <h2>Processing Steps</h2>
    <p>
        The data was used as such. We only chose to not use data from Puerto Rico.
        The datasets were joined on the state name to calculate proportions of speakers relative to the total population, and to filter out languages spoken in only a few states for certain visualizations.
        <br><br>
        All of these operations were done whithin the .js file, as the datasets were not too heavy and therefore did not need heavy operations performed on them.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>The biggest limitation is the age of the data, which dates back to between 2009 and 2013.
        Obviously, changes have occured since then which will not be reflected on the website. 
        However, considering that the website is here to provide an overview of language diversity and not to be an exact study tool
        we believe that the conclusions drawn from it are still relevant.
        <br><br>
        Another limitation is that some languages do not appear in the dataset, or are grouped under the same term regardless of the "speaking reality".
        For instance, the "Arabic" category includes all Arabic dialects, which can be very different from each other.
